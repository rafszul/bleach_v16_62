Hi Noel,


I hope you're great and enjoying the weather, weekend, holidays or whatever else there is at the moment. I'll be trying to disrupt this peaceful time


I've set up the network and I am wiring up necessary functionalities. at the same time we are filling in the content which is happening in a public repository on gitHub so you might want to go and check them out. here's one repo https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62 

you will need something more than your telephone or tablet to do so but it would be worthwhile. if you have only a smartphone or tablet then here is an update on some work on graphics http://bit.ly/1eMnovn  


in any case if we are to go anywhere with this we need to start getting people on board. I will open the network for registration and start using it for publishing exemplary instructions which would form the basic game mechanic.

All would be required from people is to register, and follow instructions on screen if there are any. If not then [They can also] simply inspect the site/page/content available. the stuff will mostly contain the materials about their potential in-game characters/profiles. They can use whatever device available provided it is connected to the net and runs a web browser 

However it could [would] make sense to get them to try running [test / run] the animation by downloading the zip from another [this] github repo, unpacking it and running index.html file (or if unavailable then any other .html file) in the main folder created in the archive folder. They would need a computer to do that.

here is a link to the repo: https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62 if they are up for it.

and two links with the animation available online: 1:  https://fanman-gentes.codio.io/ 

2: http://bleachv1662.businesscatalyst.com/ 

these links might not work properly or the content might behave strangely

I would [will] have initial instructions set up so anyone can join the game

which would [will] be fun on its own but let's not forget about the virus ;-)


we would have to think about organising the printing [we need to print x by y day]

there isn't much time but it might be [I think it is] worth the extra effort necessary to pull it off

if we are to pull it off that is

my understanding is we are

let me know whats the status and i'll get the registration open for tomorrow morning
