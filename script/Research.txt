About - from Wikipedia The paladin is a holy knight, 
crusading in the name of good and order, and is a divine 
spellcaster. By definition and game restriction, paladins 
are always of the Lawful Good alignment in DnD 1st-3rd 
editions. The 4th edition allows the Paladin to match their 
deity's alignment. Paladin characters are expected to 
demonstrate and embody goodness and law - they are not 
supposed to lie or use poison, and some interpretations say 
they should use stealth, missile weapons, and other forms of 
impersonal warfare only as a last resort. Switching to any 
alignment other than Lawful Good or breaching part of the 
Paladin's code of conduct results in a loss of all class 
abilities. The paladin is a champion of justice and 
destroyer of evil protected and strengthened by an array of 
divine powers. Most of these powers relate to providing 
benefits to those around the paladin. These include healing 
and curing of disease, morale in combat and turning of 
undead. Most of the abilities are similar to but of a lower 
level than the cleric's abilities.
